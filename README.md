# Shopiy

This is the first website I made after not touching web-development since 14,
made with bootstrap, and with the aos.js library for animations.

This project was originally made and finished in September just to see how well I could do after a few hours of studying,
and to apply whatever I learned to deepen the knowledge I acquired.
